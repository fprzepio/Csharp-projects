<h2>BMI Calculator</h2>

<p>The program is designed to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the user's input of weight and height values. BMI, a measure of body fat based on weight and height, is calculated using the formula: BMI = weight / (height^2), where weight is in kilograms and height is in meters.</p>

<p>Users are prompted to enter their weight and height. The program then performs the BMI calculation. Based on the calculated BMI, the program provides a message indicating the BMI range and any associated health risks.</p>
