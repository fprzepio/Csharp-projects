<h2> The program is designed to function as a straightforward grade calculator.</h2> 

<p>
It takes a percentage grade from a test as input and determines the corresponding letter grade based on predefined criteria. The grading scheme is as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Grade A: 90% and above</li>
  <li>Grade B: 80% - 89%</li>
  <li>Grade C: 70% - 79%</li>
  <li>Grade D: 60% - 69%</li>
  <li>Grade F: below 60%</li>
</ul>

<p>
Upon receiving the input percentage grade, the program evaluates it against the grading scheme and outputs the appropriate letter grade. This calculator aims to simplify the process of converting percentage grades into letter grades according to the specified criteria.
